# robo-trigger
LSTM/RNN trained on midi to compose midi Ã  la selective 15-track database from the 1995, SNES Masterpiece, Chrono Trigger. 

The code contained in this repo is largely due in part to **Skuldur**'s repository named [Classical-Piano-Composer](https://github.com/Skuldur/Classical-Piano-Composer), a tutorial of which can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19TQqekOlnOSW36VCL8CPVEQKBBukmaEQ#scrollTo=AC2RDfrvmq6b). 

I will begin here and implement changes and enhancements in time. Stay tuned.
